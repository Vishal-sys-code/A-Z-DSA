/*
Time Complexity:O(n).

Reason: Since the base condition is achieved only when n goes to 0, it takes n+1 recursive calls to reach 0.

Space Complexity: O(n).

Reason: We are using recursion which will internally use the stack. When n is at 0(n+1 recursive call), we would have made n recursive calls already and every functionâ€™s local variables are stored in the stack, which makes the linear space complex.
