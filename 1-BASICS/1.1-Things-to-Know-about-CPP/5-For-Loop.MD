# **for() loop**

A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times. The loop enables us to perform n number of steps together in one line. <br>

## **Syntax**

```cpp
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

* **Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

* **Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

* **Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
